According to the entity behind Bitcoin, in the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, "The root problem with conventional currencies is all the trust thatâ€™s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.". This must be the main reason why the first cryptocurrency was created in the first place.

## Is Crypto Safe?

Cryptos are backed by strong cryptography, in the case of Bitcoin, it was SHA-256 algorithm. It was developed by the the US NSA. Breaking this would be impossible as it is said that there are more possible keys in this algorithm (22<sup>56</sup>) than all the atoms in the universe<sup>[2]</sup>.
